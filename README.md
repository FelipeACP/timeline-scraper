# timeline-scraper
Google provides no API to fetch your location data, so I've created this scraper to be able to retrive this data. Unfortunately, to be able
to do it, you need a valid cookie that grants access to your google account.
Once you have it, just clone this repo, add your cookie to config.js and execute the script.
